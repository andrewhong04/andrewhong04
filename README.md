## ðŸ‘¾ About Me 
A class of 2026 student pursing a major in Computer Science. I contributed to some open-source projects such as [osu!](https://github.com/ppy/osu/commits?author=novialriptide) (the popular circle-clicking rhythm game), [pygame-ce](https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce/commits?author=novialriptide) (the fork of the popular Python game framework), and a [work-in-progress collisions library](https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-geometry/commits?author=novialriptide) written in C for pygame-ce. I am also the creator of the [pygame-ce website](https://github.com/pygame-community/pyga.me/commits?author=novialriptide) and a [PythonDiscord](https://discord.gg/python) Partner. I was also originally a contributor to the legacy [pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame/commits?author=novialriptide) project as well. I am currently developing a video game with its own game engine; you can read about it [here](https://reigngame.net/).
