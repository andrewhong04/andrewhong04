## ðŸ‘¾ About Me
A class of 2026 student and student employee studying Computer Science. I enjoy contributing
to open source projects I like such as [osu!lazer](http://github.com/ppy/osu) and
[pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame) / [pygame-ce](https://github.com/pygame-community) as well as creating my own such as
[a full stack music streaming service](https://github.com/hanamusic),
[rutgersesports.club](https://github.com/rutgersesports/rutgersesports.club), 
[a third-party pixiv app](https://github.com/novialriptide/pix), and
[a machine learning algorithm to play Super Mario Bros](https://github.com/novialriptide/Mario-NEAT).
I also have an addiction to Nintendo consoles and LEGO Star Wars.
