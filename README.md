# Hello!

I am currently a student at a state university in the United States and in my spare time contributing to open-source
repositories whenever I feel like it. Some of my major contributions led to [osu!](http://github.com/ppy/osu) and
[pygame-ce](http://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce). I have also worked on
[Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito) during my internship at Amazon Web Services.
