## ðŸ‘¾ About Me
A class of 2026 student studying Computer Science. I enjoy contributing to open source projects I like such
as [osu!](https://github.com/ppy/osu/commits?author=novialriptide) (the popular circle-clicking rhythm
game) and [pygame-ce](https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce/commits?author=novialriptide) (the fork
of the popular Python game framework). Currently I am the lead maintainer for the
[pygame-ce website](https://github.com/pygame-community/pyga.me/commits?author=novialriptide), and a
[PythonDiscord](https://discord.gg/python) Community Partner for announcing releases or events
relating to [pygame-ce](https://pyga.me). I was also originally a contributor
to the legacy [pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame/commits?author=novialriptide) project as well.
