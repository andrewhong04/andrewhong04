## ðŸ‘¾ About Me 
A class of 2026 student pursing a major in Computer Science. I enjoy contributing to open source projects
I like such as [osu!](https://github.com/ppy/osu/commits?author=novialriptide) (the popular circle-clicking
rhythm game) and [pygame-ce](https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce/commits?author=novialriptide)
(the fork of the popular Python game framework). Currently I am the lead maintainer for the
[pygame-ce website](https://github.com/pygame-community/pyga.me/commits?author=novialriptide), a
[PythonDiscord](https://discord.gg/python) Partner, and designing a new website for
[HPy](https://github.com/novialriptide/hpyproject.org)
I was also originally a contributor to the legacy
[pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame/commits?author=novialriptide) project as well.

All of my TeX and some of my Java hours are from my university assignments. All of my C hours
are from contributing to
[pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame/commits?author=novialriptide),
[pygame-ce](https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce/commits?author=novialriptide),
and [Python](https://github.com/python/cpython/commits?author=novialriptide).
