## ðŸ‘¾ About Me
A class of 2026 student studying Computer Science. I enjoy contributing to open source projects I like such
as [osu!lazer](http://github.com/ppy/osu) (the popular circle-clicking rhythm game) and
[pygame-ce](https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce) (the fork of the popular Python game framework).
## ðŸ“ˆ My Stats
Most of my Java hours are probably from my university assignments.
